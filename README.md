## Idea of the project

The idea of this project is to develop a cutting-edge supply chain management system for the pharmaceutical industry using blockchain technology, Solidity, and React. The system aims to address critical challenges faced by the pharmaceutical supply chain, such as product traceability, counterfeit prevention, transparency, and efficiency.

## Goal üöÄ

The objective of this project is to develop a secure and transparent supply chain management system for the pharmaceutical industry using blockchain technology. The system should enable real-time tracking, traceability, and verification of pharmaceutical products at every stage of the supply chain, from supplier to customer, to ensure product authenticity and safety.

## Our Solution üí°

This project implements a block chain-based supply chain management system for the pharmaceutical industry, employing Solidity smart contracts and React for the user interface. The contracts will be compiled and deployed on a local block chain network using Ganache and Truffle. To provide a user-friendly experience, a React-based frontend will be built to enable seamless interaction with the block 
chain network. The integration of the frontend and smart contracts will be achieved using Web3.js, allowing smooth 
communication and data exchange between the two components. By implementing this robust solution, the 
pharmaceutical industry can achieve real-time tracking, verification, and monitoring of products throughout the supply 
chain.

## Getting Started ‚è∞

## To deploy the Smart Contract
- Install Truffle npm package globally by running `npm install -g truffle`.
-	Install Ganache and create a workspace.

  -  Click on add network 
   - Select the network
   - Enter the details of your ganache workspace such as RPC URL and chain id as 1337 and currency symbol as eth.
